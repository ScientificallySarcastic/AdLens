// ── Period-over-period comparison ───────────────────────────────────
// Week-over-week and month-over-month, computed from the daily series.
//
// Two correctness rules this module exists to enforce:
//
// 1. Ratios are RECOMPUTED from totals, never averaged. Mean-of-daily-CTR is
//    not the CTR of the period — a day with 10 impressions would count as much
//    as a day with 100,000. CTR is total clicks ÷ total impressions.
// 2. A comparison is only reported when BOTH periods have data. Comparing a
//    full week against two days produces a dramatic, meaningless number, so
//    those cases return `null` and the UI shows nothing rather than a fiction.
