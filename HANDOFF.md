# AdLens — Engineering Handoff

Read this before changing anything. It captures **current state**, not just design.
Written for another engineer or AI assistant picking this up cold.

---

## 1. What AdLens is

An AI performance analyst for ad campaigns. Rules detect problems from metrics;
an LLM only *explains* what the rules found; every number the LLM writes is
verified against the evidence pack before it is shown. Scored 88/100 at
Checkpoint 1. The reviewer's headline note: *"the rules-do-detection /
AI-does-explanation split is actually built, not just claimed."*

**Never break that split.** The LLM must not be allowed to originate a metric.

## 2. Two modes, one app

| | Demo Mode | Live Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `lib/data.ts` — 55 seeded campaigns, deterministic | Meta Graph API → Neon Postgres |
| Campaign IDs | `summer-sale`, `c7`, … | `meta_<raw Meta id>` |
| Chosen by | any id **without** the `meta_` prefix | id **starting** `meta_` |

Routing is by ID prefix, in `MergedDataSource` (`lib/datasource.ts`). There is no
global mode flag — the prefix *is* the mode. Demo Mode must keep working
untouched; it is the graded CP1 deliverable.

## 3. Live data flow

```
System User token (env)
  → GET /act_<id>/campaigns                    campaign shells
  → GET /act_<id>/insights?level=campaign      daily campaign metrics
  → GET /{campaign_id}/adsets                  ad sets  (walked PER CAMPAIGN)
  → GET /{adset_id}/ads                        ads      (walked PER AD SET)
  → GET /act_<id>/insights?level=adset|ad      daily ad set / ad metrics
  → upsert into meta_* tables in Neon
  → UI reads ONLY from Neon, never from Meta directly
```

The hierarchy walk is deliberate: an earlier version fetched
`/act_<id>/adsets` account-wide and matched on the returned `campaign_id`,
which silently dropped ad sets. Parentage now comes from the edge queried.

**There is no OAuth.** Authentication is a long-lived System User token with
`ads_read`, stored in `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Multi-tenant OAuth would need Meta
App Review and is out of scope.

## 4. Environment variables

| Name | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Neon pooled connection string |
| `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` | live only | System User token, `ads_read` |
| `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` | live only | digits only, no `act_` prefix |
| `META_CURRENCY` | live only | e.g. `INR` — without it money renders as `$` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / … | optional | any one enables the LLM narrative; without one the deterministic analyst answers |
| `DATA_SOURCE` | optional | `merged` (default when Meta configured), `meta`, `mock` |
| `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | optional | force a provider / raise token budget |

Env vars only bind on deploy — **always redeploy after changing them.**

## 5. Current state — verified

- Demo Mode: all 8 pages render, seeded content and authored deltas unchanged
- Live sync: `{"synced":true,"campaigns":2,"dayRows":26,"adsets":2,"ads":4,"currency":"INR"}`
- Live campaign analysis renders with real values: spend ₹3,051, 252,256
  impressions, 2.93% CTR, ₹0.41 CPC, real date range, INR
- Provenance strip shows source, Meta campaign ID, objective, currency, range
- Revenue/ROAS correctly show **N/A** (the account reports no purchase value)

## 6. Current state — OPEN BUG

**The Adset Comparison tab shows "No ad sets stored for this campaign."**

Known facts:
- Ads Manager shows campaign `PC_Traffic_Jun26` HAS 1 ad set
  (`PC_Traffic_Parents_Hyd`) and 3 ads (`PC_TR_Carousel`, `PC_TR_Video1`,
  `PC_TR_Video2`)
- The sync reports `adsets: 2, ads: 4` stored account-wide
- The UI reports "1 ad set in the account belongs to other campaigns"
- So ad sets are being stored, but not against the campaign being viewed

Three candidate causes, in likelihood order:

1. **The sync has not been re-run since the hierarchical walk shipped.** The
   stored rows are from the older account-wide fetch. → re-run
   `/api/sync/meta?days=30`.
2. **A migration column is missing**, so the adset read query throws. The read
   path now surfaces this as `adsetError` in `/api/db/campaign-detail` and
   prints it in the tab. → run `ALL_IN_ONE_live.sql`.
3. **Orphaned rows** — `meta_adsets.campaign_id` doesn't match any
   `meta_campaigns.id`. → `99_diagnose.sql` block 3 proves this in one query.

**The single piece of evidence that resolves it:** the JSON from
`/api/sync/meta?days=30`. It now returns a `hierarchy` array giving ad set and
ad counts **per campaign**. That array answers the question directly. It has not
yet been captured after the hierarchical walk shipped.

## 7. Debugging order

1. Run `ALL_IN_ONE_live.sql` in Neon
2. Redeploy
3. `GET /api/sync/meta?days=30` — read the `hierarchy` array
4. `GET /api/db/status` — expect `db:true`, non-zero `metaCampaigns`
5. Open a live campaign → Adset tab → it now prints the real Postgres error if
   the read fails
6. `04_verify.sql` for row counts + hierarchy; `99_diagnose.sql` for everything

## 8. Design rules — do not violate

- **No fabricated numbers in Live Mode.** Every displayed figure must trace to a
  Graph API field or a stated calculation. Seeded literals (`↑12%`,
  `Snapshot · Today 02:00`, `25–44 Male`) are gated behind `!isLive`.
- **Unavailable ≠ zero.** Missing metrics render `N/A` with a reason. Days with
  no conversions are `null` in `cpaTrend` so charts show a gap, not a zero line.
- **Revenue comes from `conv_value`**, never `roas × spend`.
- **Results are objective-specific** — purchases for Sales, landing page views
  for Traffic, leads for Leads — matching Ads Manager's Results column. The KPI
  card is labelled with what it counted.
- **No silent fallbacks in Live Mode.** A failed live read returns an error, not
  an empty array. (This rule was added *because* a `.catch(() => [])` disguised a
  real failure as "no data" and cost hours.)
- **Never widen the LLM's authority.** It receives an evidence pack and writes
  prose; `verifyCitations` rejects any number not present in that pack.
- **Currency via `lib/currency.ts` only.** Never hardcode `$`.
- **Hooks before early returns.** A `useEffect` placed after the loading-state
  return caused a hook-count crash on live campaigns.

## 9. Known limitations (documented, not bugs)

- Share-of-target-audience is not derivable from the Insights API — no
  saturation percentage anywhere. Absolute peak-day reach is shown instead.
- `verifyCitations` matches values, not entities: a real number attributed to
  the wrong ad set would pass. Flagged at CP1; still open.
- Campaign pacing needs a budget; when budgets live at ad set level the sum is
  used, otherwise pacing shows "budget not reported".
- Cross-platform compare mode is untested with a live account selected.

## 10. Layout

```
lib/
  data.ts          seeded dataset + shared types (Campaign, AdSet, AdItem)
  datasource.ts    DataSource interface; Mock / Meta / Merged implementations
  meta.ts          Graph API fetchers + Neon readers/mappers  ← live logic
  meta-labels.ts   objective → result-type ladder (client-safe)
  reasoning.ts     evidence builder, deterministic analyst, citation verifier
  llm.ts           provider-agnostic narrative layer (7 providers)
  currency.ts      single money-formatting helper
app/api/sync/meta  the ONLY route that calls Meta
app/api/db/*       read routes: status, accounts, campaign-detail, adset-detail
```
